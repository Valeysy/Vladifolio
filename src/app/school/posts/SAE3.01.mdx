## Consigne

The project involved developing a comprehensive smart home automation system that integrates a mobile application, a web interface, and two connected smart plugs. The system allows users to control the smart plugs via the web or mobile application by sending and receiving MQTT messages on ESP devices.

## Réalisation

I was part of a team that developed a user-friendly mobile application for seamless control of smart plugs, implementing the MQTT protocol for real-time communication with ESP devices. We also built a web interface using Django, providing a robust and scalable backend, enabling users to monitor and control smart plugs through a web browser. Additionally, we integrated two smart plugs with ESP modules for connectivity, ensuring reliable communication through MQTT messaging.

## Compétences acquises

- Utilization of the MQTT Protocol for efficient and real-time message transmission between devices.
- Leveraging the Django Framework for developing a secure and scalable web interface.
- Deployment of ESP Modules for seamless integration and control of smart plugs.

## Ressenti

Successfully implementing a fully functional smart home automation system was a significant achievement. It enabled remote control of smart plugs via both mobile and web platforms, ensuring robust and real-time communication through the MQTT protocol. This project enhanced my skills in developing integrated systems and working with real-time communication protocols.
