## Instructions

Conduct in-depth research and summarize alternatives to GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) and create a group video.

## Implementation

I took the initiative to distribute work among my colleagues by developing an equitable division of tasks and establishing a system for textual collaboration. Following the presentation of our research to other colleagues, the professor provided advice to improve and refine our presentation. Subsequently, I recorded a video of the second version of my presentation and edited it.

## Experience

I really enjoyed the group work for this SAE. Collaborating with my colleagues allowed me to discover new methods of research and knowledge sharing. We worked together to explore alternatives to GAFAM, which enriched our understanding of the different technologies available. I also found it fascinating to see how each person could bring their own perspective and unique skills to contribute to a common project. This experience not only allowed me to learn new things but also strengthened my teamwork and communication skills.
