## Essential Components

CE3.01 | Listening to client needs  
CE3.02 | Documenting the work done  
CE3.03 | Using digital tools wisely  
CE3.04 | Choosing appropriate development tools  
CE3.05 | Integrating security issues  

## What I Learned

I created documentation (CE3.02) on e-reputation, which inspired me to build my own website using the VSCode editor (CE3.04). This site consists of a set of files (AC13.04) including 4 HTML files that manage the content of each page, a CSS file for styling, and several images in SVG, PNG, and JPEG formats for the tab icon and page illustrations.

Additionally, in collaboration with another student via GitHub (AC13.06), we developed a Python script to simulate a "man-in-the-middle" attack, allowing us to observe traffic between two machines on the network in a test context only (CE3.03). This script is designed to run on Kali Linux (AC13.01), an operating system optimized for ethical hacking. In preparation, we also developed a Python program (AC13.03) to retrieve the MAC address of a targeted machine via its IP address, either passively or actively, and to list all machines connected to the network. We had to read, execute, and modify this program multiple times to ensure it met our objectives (AC13.02).
