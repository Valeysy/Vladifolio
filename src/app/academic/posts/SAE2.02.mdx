## Instructions

Create, using Tinkercad, a diagram to play piano notes and another diagram using FFT to recognize piano keys and turn on an LED.

## Implementation

For our project, my partner and I decided to separate the tasks to optimize our efficiency. Each of us tackled the creation of a specific model: I took charge of the part concerning the operation of an LED. After developing our components individually, we brought our models together to work on interconnecting the different elements. This step allowed us to test the compatibility of our modules and make the necessary adjustments to ensure their harmonious functioning. This collaborative process was crucial for the success of the project and strengthened our ability to solve technical problems together.
