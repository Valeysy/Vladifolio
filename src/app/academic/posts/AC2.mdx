## Essential Components

CE2.01 | Communicating with the client and various stakeholders, sometimes in English  
CE2.02 | Demonstrating a scientific approach  
CE2.03 | Choosing appropriate solutions and technologies  
CE2.04 | Proposing environmentally friendly solutions  

## What I Learned

In collaboration with my team (AC12.05), I designed a plan and created an Acrylic heatmap (CE2.03) to analyze Wi-Fi coverage in a building at our institution. This work aimed to identify problematic areas and specific needs for wireless equipment connections. Subsequently, I installed an access point (AC12.03), evaluated its range, and assessed its impact on neighboring channels through signal tests. I also measured data transfer rates at various distances from the access point.

The results were synthesized into detailed graphs and analyses in a report (AC12.01). The installation includes an access point that uses a single cable for power and data, thanks to a switch that provides power via PoE ports. I configured these ports to be active only during the day to reduce nighttime energy consumption (CE2.04).

## Critical Learning

AC12.01 | Measure, analyze, and comment on signals
