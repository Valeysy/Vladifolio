## Instructions

Create a site using the Django framework on a specific topic. It must be hosted on two virtual machines: one VM for the database and another for the web service.

## Implementation

I took charge of creating the Gantt chart, which allowed for efficient structuring and planning of the project. To organize the work, I divided the tasks according to each team member's skills and set clear deadlines. On the technical side, I developed the CRUD functionalities to ensure smooth data management within the application. For deployment, I configured and launched the application on a Linux server, using Nginx and Gunicorn, ensuring a secure and efficient connection between the web server and the Python application. Finally, I implemented the database, designing its structure to optimize performance and security, while ensuring data integrity and efficient recovery.
