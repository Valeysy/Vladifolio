## Instructions

Worked as part of a team to implement a multisite network using protocols such as RIP, OSPF, BGP, route reflector, vpnv4, VRF, and NAT.

## Implementation

- **Multisite Network**: Designed and configured a multisite network architecture.
- **Routing Protocols**: Implemented RIP, OSPF, and BGP for efficient routing across sites.
- **Route Reflector**: Utilized route reflectors to optimize BGP configurations.
- **VPN and VRF**: Configured vpnv4 and VRF for secure and isolated network segments.
- **NAT**: Applied NAT for address translation and network security.

## Skills Acquired

- **Network Configuration**: Mastered the setup of complex network protocols and architectures.
- **Routing Management**: Enhanced skills in managing dynamic routing protocols and route reflectors.
- **Network Security**: Implemented secure networking practices using VPNs and NAT.

## Experience

Collaborating on the development of a multisite network was a rewarding experience. It provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of advanced networking protocols and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
