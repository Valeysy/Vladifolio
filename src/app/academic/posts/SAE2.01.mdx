## Instructions

Design and implement a network model and implement network services such as FTP and Rsync, as well as the implementation of access control lists (ACLs) to secure data. Enable the interconnection of models.

## Implementation

I used GNS3 to create a complete network model. In this context, I configured inter-VLAN connectivity, which allowed for efficient network segmentation. I set up several servers, each dedicated to a specific service such as FTP and Rsync, to facilitate file sharing and synchronization within the network. I also configured access control lists (ACLs) to improve network security. Finally, I successfully interconnected the various models, allowing for smooth communication between the different segments of my test environment. This experience allowed me to strengthen my network and system administration skills.

## Skills Acquired

- Creating a more complex network
- Server configuration
- FTP service configuration
- Implementation of ACLs
- DHCP

## Experience

I really enjoyed this SAE as it allowed me to work on designing and implementing a complex network model. Using GNS3 to create a complete network model was very educational, especially for configuring inter-VLAN connectivity and implementing network services like FTP and Rsync. Setting up access control lists (ACLs) to secure data was also a very instructive aspect. This experience strengthened my network and system administration skills.

However, I criticize an abusive grading system that does not accurately represent the student's actual work. Additionally, there was a clear lack of precision in the grading, which made the evaluation unfair and frustrating. A fairer grading system and better-defined evaluation criteria would have greatly improved the overall experience of this project.
