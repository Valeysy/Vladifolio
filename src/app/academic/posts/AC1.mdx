## What I Learned

I enhanced my understanding of IT security by exploring open-source alternatives to GAFAM and learning secure web browsing principles to minimize data collection. My research enabled me to comprehend various open-source solutions and broaden my technological knowledge.

Using Eve NG, I configured basic network functions, including IP addressing, network segmentation with VLANs and dot1q encapsulation, and inter-VLAN routing. After setting up the network, I added "VPCS" client stations, modified their hostnames, and configured DHCP. I also utilized the Linux operating system to establish a DHCP service for the network.
