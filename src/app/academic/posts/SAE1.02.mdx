## Instructions

Create a local network on EVE NG to interconnect VLANs and implement a DHCP service.

## Implementation

I selected EVE NG as the virtualization solution. This platform is comprehensive as it integrates images of various systems such as Cisco and Linux. The topology was established according to the project specifications. Each sector or VLAN was represented by a single device. For the switch configuration, I used previously learned commands to create and assign ports to the appropriate VLANs.

## Experience

I found this SAE enriching in terms of technical learning, particularly in configuring a local network on EVE NG and manipulating VLANs and a DHCP service. However, I was disappointed by the educational aspect of the grading. There was a notable discrepancy between the provided instructions and the grading criteria, which made the evaluation less clear and fair. This inconsistency diminished my enthusiasm for the project, despite my interest in the technical tasks.
