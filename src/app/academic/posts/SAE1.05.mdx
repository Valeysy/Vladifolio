## Instructions

Work in pairs to develop two distinct scripts. The first script should identify machines connected to the network, listing their IP and MAC addresses. The second script should carry out a "man-in-the-middle" attack to intercept and analyze traffic between two specific machines on the network.

## Implementation

I learned to use Scapy to send and receive packets and quickly created a script to detect devices on a network and retrieve their MAC addresses. I modified my network interface parameters to listen to all packets. Inspired by existing scripts, I adapted one specific to Kali Linux. Through testing with VMWare and several virtual machines running Debian and Kali Linux, I successfully visualized the frames with Wireshark.

## Experience

I greatly appreciated working in pairs for this SAE. Collaborating with a colleague allowed us to share our ideas and skills to develop effective Python scripts. I found using Scapy very interesting for capturing and analyzing network packets, and it helped me better understand how networks function.

However, I disliked the lack of clear instructions. We were taught about Scapy in just one class, and then asked to complete such a complex project. This made the task particularly difficult and frustrating. Additionally, the grading was very random, which added to the confusion and general frustration. Better preparation and more detailed instructions would have greatly improved the experience and learning.
