## Instructions

I developed a comprehensive project aimed at providing one or more solutions with a detailed quote in response to a call for tender for Lor, a pastry company specializing in online sales. The project focused on implementing a virtualized infrastructure to enhance scalability, performance, and security, particularly during peak periods such as Christmas, Easter, and Valentine's Day.

## Implementation

- **High Availability**: Ensured continuous availability of the e-commerce site and administrative management system
- **Cost Optimization**: Dynamically adjusted resources to manage costs effectively during varying demand periods
- **Data Security**: Implemented robust data security measures in compliance with GDPR regulations
- **Efficient Management**: Utilized managed and automated solutions to streamline operations

## Evidence

### Full Cloud Solution (OVH)

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: The OVH cloud solution offers dynamic resource adjustment, allowing for seamless scaling during high-traffic periods
- **Automated Backups**: Fully automated backups stored in the cloud, minimizing data loss risks
- **Global Accessibility**: Services like Odoo are accessible from anywhere, enhancing operational flexibility

### Hybrid Solution (Nemesius + On-Premise)

- **Cost-Effective Storage**: Utilizes a local NAS for extensive storage at a lower cost
- **Enhanced Security**: Limits Odoo access to internal use, reducing exposure to external threats
- **Fixed Monthly Costs**: Provides predictable monthly expenses with an initial investment in hardware

## Skills Acquired

- **Resource Provisioning**: Immediate resource allocation with OVH and a more extended setup for the hybrid solution
- **Backup Strategies**: Regular backups with OVH and enhanced local backup solutions with the hybrid approach
- **Load Balancing**: Efficient traffic management to ensure optimal performance during peak times

## Experience

This project successfully addressed the critical needs of Lor by providing two viable infrastructure solutions. The choice between the full cloud solution and the hybrid approach depends on the company's prioritiesâ€”whether they value maximum flexibility and global accessibility or prefer cost control and enhanced data security.

This project underscores my ability to design and implement robust IT solutions tailored to specific business needs, ensuring high availability, security, and cost efficiency.
