## Instructions

End-of-year project encompassing all resources and SAEs. The goal is to create a network (Switch, Router, VLAN) connected to the Internet via a DNS, integrating an IP phone, an FTP server, and to code a Django site to display a database. The database is taken from a broker provided by the professor.

## Implementation

I was part of a team of three people, with Benjamin Knoblauch and Alan Akgun. We decided to divide the tasks into three parts. Personally, I took care of the network, Django CRUD operations and templates, as well as some telephony. I was able to consolidate my knowledge in networking. Despite some initial difficulties with DNS, I managed to set up a functional and reliable network, allowing us to advance on our projects. Subsequently, I assisted with telephony, particularly supporting Alan with external peripherals and testing Linphone calls. Finally, I helped Benjamin create Django CRUD operations and templates. I also assisted with database management by helping him with commands.

- Consolidating Django CRUD operations and templates
- Consolidating database management
- Reviewing Linphone telephony
- Teamwork
- Time management
- Stress management

## Experience

I greatly enjoyed this SAE as it allowed me to consolidate my knowledge in networking and learn new skills using Django. Working in a group with Benjamin and Alan was an enriching experience. We managed to structure and plan our project effectively by dividing the tasks equitably. On the technical side, I took charge of setting up the network, CRUD functionalities, and Django templates, while also contributing to telephony management. This experience not only allowed me to improve my technical skills but also strengthened my ability to work in a team and manage my time and stress.
