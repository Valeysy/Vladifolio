## Overview

Coordinate modular infrastructures and support application development within a virtualized environment. Focus on implementing and configuring the components of these infrastructures to ensure flexibility and security in network operations.

## Implementation

As a professional specializing in System and Cloud Development, I ensured the installation of servers and hypervisors by selecting appropriate hardware or software solutions. I created virtual machines to deploy various services and managed shared hardware resources across different services. I also maintained service performance and facilitated rapid recovery in case of failures using replication tools. This involved leveraging the advantages of a virtualized infrastructure and measuring the benefits of virtualization to provide network performance indicators to the company.

## Experience

Participating in this project was a rewarding experience. Coordinating with my colleagues allowed me to explore new methods of collaboration and knowledge sharing. We worked together to implement and manage virtualized infrastructures, enhancing our understanding of cloud technologies. Each team member contributed unique perspectives and skills, enriching the project. This experience not only expanded my technical expertise but also strengthened my teamwork and communication abilities.
