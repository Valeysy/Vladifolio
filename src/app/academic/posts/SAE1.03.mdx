## Instructions

Analyze and measure Wi-Fi coverage in a building, create a heatmap, and implement a wireless access point with appropriate configuration.

## Implementation

I worked with my team to design a plan and create an Acrylic heatmap to analyze Wi-Fi coverage in our institution's building. We identified problematic areas and specific needs for wireless equipment connections. I then proceeded to install an access point, evaluated its range and impact on neighboring channels through signal testing. I also measured data transfer rates at various distances from the access point.

## Experience

I found this SAE enriching in terms of technical learning, particularly in analyzing Wi-Fi signals and implementing wireless solutions. The practical experience of creating heatmaps and measuring signal strength provided valuable insights into real-world network deployment scenarios.

## Skills Acquired

- Wi-Fi signal analysis and measurement
- Heatmap creation and interpretation
- Access point installation and configuration
- Signal strength testing and optimization
- Power over Ethernet (PoE) implementation
- Energy-efficient network design

## Achievements

- AC12.01: Measure, analyze, and comment on signals
- AC12.03: Deploy transmission media
- AC12.05: Communicate with a third party (client, colleague, etc.) and adapt one's speech and language to the interlocutor
