## Overview of DevCloud Development

The DevCloud Development unit focuses on designing a multi-site computer network that hosts virtualized services. It aims to equip students with the skills to coordinate modular infrastructures, administer networks and the Internet, and connect businesses and users. The professional challenge is to regularly evolve the network and services to maintain a secure infrastructure that allows various company sites to access resources both on-site and in the Cloud.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Configure and troubleshoot dynamic routing within a network.
- Implement and explain a simple QoS policy and basic network security functions.
- Deploy client workstations and virtualized solutions tailored to specific situations.
- Establish secure remote access and multi-site connections via operator networks.
- Virtualize an environment as part of the SAE3.DevCloud.04 project.

## Implementation

In this unit, I took the initiative to distribute tasks among my colleagues, ensuring an equitable division of labor. We collaborated to explore alternatives to GAFAM, which involved conducting in-depth research and creating a group video. The professor provided feedback to refine our presentation, which I then recorded and edited into a final video.

## Experience

Participating in this unit was a rewarding experience. Working in a team allowed me to discover new research methods and share knowledge effectively. We explored various technologies, enhancing our understanding of alternatives to GAFAM. This collaborative effort not only expanded my technical skills but also improved my teamwork and communication abilities.

## Skills Acquired

- Planning and coordinating group tasks.
- Developing strategic frameworks for projects.
- Organizing and exploring ideas systematically.
- Compiling and submitting comprehensive reports.
