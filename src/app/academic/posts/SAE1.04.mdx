## Instructions

Create a document that describes your online presence and explains how to build your e-reputation. Design a website with a general homepage and a page dedicated to a specific activity (in English).

## Implementation

I prepared a document about my e-reputation, which I consider rather positive. I also detailed the planned structure for my website, organized into several distinct modules. Having acquired skills in HTML and CSS during my studies, I designed a web page according to my preferences. I used the same CSS structure to develop another page dedicated to my passion for design.

## Experience

I really enjoyed this SAE because coding my own website offered me an enriching learning experience. While working on this project, I was able to not only strengthen my coding skills but also better understand how web technologies work. It allowed me to see concretely how different parts of a website come together and interact, which added a practical and tangible dimension to my theoretical knowledge. This activity was both a challenge and an excellent opportunity to apply what I had learned in class.

## Skills Acquired
